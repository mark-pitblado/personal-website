Hi, I'm Mark! Thanks for stopping by my site. Here you will find a little bit about me, some posts that I have written, and links to other websites or services that I have a presence on. If you with to get in touch, please use the email logo in the footer, and I'll respond as soon as I can.

I grew up loving to tinker with things, and never really stopped. If I were to describe what I do, I would summarize it as "using data to help solve problems for the public good". In my free time I love to read, and explore new and emerging open-source software. Currently, I am very excited to be a new member to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) and hope to explore how I can contribute to that mission.
