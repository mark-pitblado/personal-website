I have been working on transitioning more of my sites to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) after becoming a member, and today was the day that I took the plunge into using their hosted [Woodpecker CI](https://woodpecker-ci.org) instance. You have to [apply for access](https://docs.codeberg.org/ci/) by submitting an issue to the [requests repository](https://codeberg.org/Codeberg-e.V./requests#woodpecker-ci), however the process was very quick and painless. Within a few days I had been approved and had access.

To start, I wanted to configure my [notes](https://notes.markpitblado.me) because it was the simpliest and almost certainly receives the least traffic. I laid out the following steps to facilitate the transition:

1. Turn off mirroring of the codeberg repository to the github repository previously used for vercel deployment.
2. Configure the woodpecker-ci via `.woodpecker.yml` and ensure that it was working.
3. Add the `.domain` file so that notes.markpitblado.me would redirect to the codeberg pages server.

## Setting up woodpecker-ci

Fortunately, there was already an example configuration for [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) available in the [ci examples repository](https://codeberg.org/Codeberg-CI/examples). I just had to copy the `woodpecker.yml` file listed in the mdbook directory.

```yaml showLineNumbers
clone:
  git:
    image: woodpeckerci/plugin-git

when:
  branch: master
  event: [push, cron]

steps:
  build:
    image: peaceiris/mdbook:latest
    commands:
      - mdbook build

  publish:
    image: bitnami/git
    secrets: [mail, codeberg_token]
    environment:
      - MDBOOK_OUTPUT=book
    commands:
      - git config --global user.email $MAIL
      - git config --global user.name "Woodpecker CI"
      - git clone -b pages https://$CODEBERG_TOKEN@codeberg.org/$CI_REPO.git $CI_REPO_NAME
      - cp -ar $MDBOOK_OUTPUT/. $CI_REPO_NAME/
      - cp .domains $CI_REPO_NAME || true
      - cd $CI_REPO_NAME
      - git add .
      - git commit -m "Woodpecker CI ${CI_BUILD_CREATED}"
      - git push
```

Note that this file uses two secrets: `mail`, and `codeberg_token`. The `mail` token should be set to whichever email is used for your git commits, and the `codeberg_token` can be obtained by going into your codeberg Account Settings > Applications and then generating a new token. You should only need to give the token read/write access to repositories. Copy the token into woodpecker-ci under the repositories secrets. Make sure to call the secret `codeberg_token` exactly. **Never expose this token publicly, including in any commits.** It should only be managed through the woodpecker secrets manager. More documentation on woodpecker secrets can be found [in the woodpecker documentation](https://woodpecker-ci.org/docs/usage/secrets)

Next, I had to change branch `master` to `main` to match the setup for my repository.

```yaml {2} showLineNumbers
when:
  branch: main
  event: [push, cron]
```

## Deploying

Deploying was simple. As soon as I committed the `woodpecker.yml` file and pushed to main, the ci pipeline triggered and was observable from the woodpecker GUI. After fixing the master -> main issue, it worked without any further troubleshooting. Before running, I checked that the peaceiris/mdbook and bitnami/git images were still active. If you are reading this many years in the future, you may need to switch these images if they are no longer maintained.

## Setting up the custom domain

To use the notes.markpitblado.me domain with the codeberg page, I had to add a `.domains` file at the root of the repository. It is a very simple text file, that in this case, just includes a single line.

```
notes.markpitblado.me
```

This `.domains` file should automatically be copied over into the pages branch when you commit and push for the first time.

I then pointed the domain to the site via a CNAME record to `notes.mark-pitblado.codeberg.page`. Documentation on using custom domains with codeberg pages can be found [in the codeberg documentation](https://docs.codeberg.org/codeberg-pages/using-custom-domain/).

The finalized setup can be found [in the codeberg repository for my notes](https://codeberg.org/mark-pitblado/notes)

## Next steps

The big task is migrating my main site (this site) next. I may try to configure woodpecker to send the deployment to vercel instead of using codeberg pages. Prettier should hopefully be quite easy as there is a [woodpecker prettier plugin](https://woodpecker-ci.org/plugins/Prettier)
